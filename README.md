*Library Management System*
Welcome to the Library Management System! This project was built using Java with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing. It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and is ideal for managing library operations like adding, deleting, renting, and returning books.

*Features*
Add Book: Add books with details like title, author, price, and rent cost.
Delete Book: Remove books if they are not rented.
Rent Book: Mark a book as rented.
Return Book: Return rented books.
Inventory Display: View the current status of all books.

*Tech Stack*
Java (Core Logic)
Swing (Graphical User Interface)
OOP Principles (Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation)

*OOP Concepts Applied*
Abstraction: Book is an abstract class that defines common properties.
Inheritance: RentableBook extends the Book class to provide renting functionality.
Polymorphism: The rent() method is overridden in RentableBook.
Encapsulation: Private fields with getter methods ensure data protection.

*Future Enhancements*
Integrate a database for persistent storage.
Implement user authentication.
Add advanced search and filter options.
